# KeyCrafter
KeyCrafter is a minimal yet powerful Python-based password generation engine, designed to work both as a CLI tool and an importable API module for developers. It leverages cryptographically secure randomness (secrets module) to generate strong, customizable passwords for real-world use cases â€” from dev tooling to user-facing apps.
